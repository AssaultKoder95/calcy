# Calcy - The Ultimate Calculator
A demo react app of our most famous web applications - Calculator

Current state of demo contains:

-  Basic Calculations

## Basic Structure
The component structure of the app is simple, we have a main component called `App` inside which our components reside.

### Component STRUCTURE:

- APP
  - Header
  - Calculator
    - Result UI
    - Number pattern display UI
    - Operations pattern display UI

## Future

#### Core Logic
The current implementation uses eval function which will be removed in future.
A stack based approach will be implemented.

#### UI
The current implementation is a very basic UI.
A new intutive layout of the calculator will be implemented.

#### Features
The list of features that I might develop in future:

- Advance Calculations
- Series generator (AP, GP, Fibonacci etc.)
- Finding specific elements of a given series 

#### Testing
A test suite will be added in the future in order to verify the functionality of the app.
